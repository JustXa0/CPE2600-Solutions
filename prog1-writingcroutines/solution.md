# Programming Assignment 1

For this assigment, I spent the most time on the is_prime function due to the complexity of the ending position. After spending several hours on this problem, I consulted an online source for help. There I found the solution and made sure to explain how I arrived at this conclusion and give credit to the source.

The rest of this programming assignment was pretty straight forward, with the second most difficult function, print_addition_series_endpoints not taking more than a few hours.

## Grade

I received a grade of 93/100, with 5 marks off for not including suggestions to improve the assignment, 1 mark for coding standards, and 1 mark for documentation on the top of assignments.

## Learnings

From this assignment, I learned how to implement a Makefile, computations in C, and general testing in C.
